# JavaThemeLibrary
Java Theme Library Project using Swing-Library
Created a Java package that implements a prettier GUI than Swing; built an implementation that uses Swing components internally but abstracts it away in my own mini library.
Comes with a full UML.
Uses design patterns such as Model View Controller (MVC), Decorator and Composite. Also explores inheritance and modularization.
